# Daily SQL Loads
This script is for running a SQL script that needs to dynamically shift in 1 day intervals. If you want to run an insert statement into a file for every day from a table, you can set up the SQL to shift one day at a time. It also takes in variables that can be shifted depending on when the current_date is in the for loop.
